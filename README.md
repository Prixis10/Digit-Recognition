# 🖥️ Digit Recognition: Kaggle Digit Recognizer Competition

Predicting handwritten digit recognition using deep learning with comprehensive data visualization and model building using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview 📜

This repository contains my solutions and analyses for the Kaggle competition ["Digit Recognizer"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). The goal is to predict handwritten digit recognition using deep learning techniques. This project was undertaken as an introductory project in deep learning.

## Project Overview 🧩

### 1. Data Exploration and Visualization 🔍

- Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and content.
- Visualize important features using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify patterns and relationships.

### 2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering 🔧

- Clean the data by handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies.
- Normalize and scale features as necessary.

### 3. Model Building and Evaluation 🤖

- Implemented an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Evaluated the model using appropriate performance metrics.
- Fine-tuned the model parameters to optimize performance.

### 4. Submission 📤

- Generated predictions for the test dataset using the trained ANN model.
- Formatted the predictions according to Kaggle’s submission requirements.
- Submitted the results to Kaggle and achieved a global ranking of 1271.
