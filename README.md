# 🖥️ Digit Recognition: Kaggle Digit Recognizer Competition

Predicting handwritten digit recognition using deep learning with comprehensive data visualization and model building using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview 📜

This repository contains solutions and analyses for the Kaggle competition ["Digit Recognizer"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. The objective of this project is to accurately classify and recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using deep learning techniques. The project includes exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and submission to Kaggle for scoring.

## Project Overview 🧩

### 1. Data Exploration and Visualization 🔍

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to gain insights into the structure and characteristics of the dataset. Visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are utilized to understand the distribution of classes, examine feature relationships, and identify patterns within the data.

### 2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering 🔧

Data preprocessing involves cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and correcting inconsistencies. Feature engineering techniques such as normalization and scaling are applied to prepare the data for model training.

### 3. Model Building and Evaluation 🤖

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture is designed to effectively learn and classify handwritten digits from the input images. The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Hyperparameter tuning and optimization techniques are employed to enhance model performance.

### 4. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Implementation 🌟

In addition to the ANN model, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is implemented to further improve classification accuracy. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies of features.

### 5. Submission and Kaggle Ranking 📤

Final predictions are generated for the test dataset using the trained models. The predictions are formatted according to Kaggle’s submission requirements and submitted to the Kaggle competition platform for evaluation. The achieved ranking and score on Kaggle are documented to assess the performance of the developed models.
